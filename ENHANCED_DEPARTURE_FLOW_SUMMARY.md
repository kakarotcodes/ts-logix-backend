# Enhanced Departure Flow Implementation Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

The TSLogix backend has been enhanced with a comprehensive departure flow that includes approval workflow, expiry-based FIFO prioritization, and all mandatory fields as requested. This implementation follows the same pattern as the entry order flow but optimized for departure operations.

## âœ… Implemented Features

### 1. **Approval Workflow**
- **Status Flow**: `PENDING â†’ APPROVED/REVISION/REJECTED â†’ DISPATCHED â†’ COMPLETED`
- **Role-based Permissions**:
  - **CLIENT**: Can create departure orders
  - **WAREHOUSE_INCHARGE/ADMIN**: Can approve, reject, request revision, and dispatch
- **Separate Approval and Dispatch**: Orders must be approved before they can be dispatched

### 2. **Expiry-Based FIFO Prioritization**
- **Primary Sort**: Expiration date (earliest expiry first)
- **Secondary Sort**: Entry date (oldest entry first if expiry dates are same)
- **Urgency Levels**: EXPIRED, URGENT (â‰¤7 days), WARNING (â‰¤30 days), NORMAL
- **Automatic Suggestions**: System automatically suggests FIFO allocations based on expiry dates

### 3. **Mandatory Fields Compliance**
All mandatory fields are now enforced:
- âœ… Departure order code
- âœ… Product code
- âœ… Product name  
- âœ… Lot number
- âœ… Quantity inventory unit
- âœ… Quantity (packaging)
- âœ… Packaging type
- âœ… Dispatch document number
- âœ… Pallet/position quantity
- âœ… Entry order date and time
- âœ… Dispatch date and time
- âœ… Entry order number
- âœ… Document upload
- âœ… Document type (multi-select)

### 4. **Enhanced Database Schema**
- **Updated OrderStatusDeparture enum** with approval workflow states
- **Added dispatch tracking fields** (separate from approval)
- **Multi-select document types** support
- **Enhanced audit logging** for complete traceability

## ðŸ“Š API Endpoints

### Core Departure Management
- `GET /departure/departure-formfields` - Get form dropdown data
- `GET /departure/departure-orders` - List departure orders (with status filtering)
- `POST /departure/create-departure-order` - Create new departure order
- `GET /departure/departure-orders/:id` - Get departure order details

### Approval Workflow (WAREHOUSE_INCHARGE/ADMIN only)
- `POST /departure/departure-orders/:id/approve` - Approve departure order
- `POST /departure/departure-orders/:id/reject` - Reject departure order  
- `POST /departure/departure-orders/:id/request-revision` - Request revision

### Dispatch Operations (WAREHOUSE_INCHARGE/ADMIN only)
- `POST /departure/departure-orders/:id/dispatch` - Dispatch single order
- `POST /departure/departure-orders/batch-dispatch` - Batch dispatch multiple orders

### Expiry-Based FIFO
- `GET /departure/products-with-inventory` - Get products with expiry-based FIFO
- `GET /departure/products/:id/fifo-locations` - Get FIFO locations for product
- `GET /departure/products/:id/fifo-allocation` - Get suggested FIFO allocation

### Inventory & Validation
- `GET /departure/inventory-summary` - Get departure inventory summary
- `POST /departure/validate-cell` - Validate single cell selection
- `POST /departure/validate-multiple-cells` - Validate multiple cells

## ðŸ”„ Workflow Process

### 1. **Creation Phase**
```
CLIENT/WAREHOUSE_INCHARGE/ADMIN creates departure order
â†“
Order status: PENDING
â†“
All mandatory fields validated
â†“
Order awaits approval
```

### 2. **Approval Phase**
```
WAREHOUSE_INCHARGE/ADMIN reviews order
â†“
APPROVE â†’ Status: APPROVED (ready for dispatch)
REJECT â†’ Status: REJECTED (order cancelled)
REVISION â†’ Status: REVISION (can be edited and resubmitted)
```

### 3. **Dispatch Phase**
```
WAREHOUSE_INCHARGE/ADMIN selects inventory (expiry-based FIFO)
â†“
System validates inventory availability
â†“
Execute dispatch (removes from inventory)
â†“
Order status: DISPATCHED
â†“
Complete audit trail created
```

## ðŸš€ Key Improvements

### 1. **Expiry Management**
- Products nearing expiry are prioritized for dispatch
- Automatic urgency classification
- Expiry alerts and warnings
- Complete expiry date tracking throughout the flow

### 2. **Role-Based Security**
- Strict permission controls
- Audit logging for all actions
- User context preservation
- Organization-based data filtering

### 3. **Data Integrity**
- Comprehensive validation at all levels
- Synchronization checks between quantity and weight
- Foreign key validation
- Transaction-based operations

### 4. **Traceability**
- Complete audit trail from entry to dispatch
- Lot number tracking
- Entry order linkage
- Packaging code management
- Document upload tracking

## ðŸ“‹ Mandatory Fields Implementation

### Database Level
- Schema constraints ensure mandatory fields cannot be null
- Multi-select document types stored as arrays
- Dispatch tracking separate from approval status

### API Level
- Validation middleware enforces all mandatory fields
- Descriptive error messages for missing fields
- Field-specific validation rules

### Business Logic Level
- Expiry date validation and prioritization
- Inventory synchronization checks
- Role-based operation permissions
- Workflow state management

## ðŸ”§ Technical Architecture

### Service Layer (`departure.service.js`)
- **Enhanced FIFO Logic**: Expiry-date-first prioritization
- **Approval Workflow**: Status management and role validation
- **Dispatch Processing**: Inventory removal and audit logging
- **Validation Engine**: Comprehensive data validation

### Controller Layer (`departure.controller.js`)
- **Role-Based Endpoints**: Different permissions for different roles
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Event logging for all operations
- **Error Handling**: Detailed error responses
- **Input Validation**: Request data validation

### Route Layer (`departure.route.js`)
- **Organized Endpoints**: Logical grouping of related operations
- **Authentication Required**: All endpoints require valid JWT tokens
- **RESTful Design**: Consistent API design patterns

## ðŸŽ¯ Business Impact

### 1. **Improved Efficiency**
- Automatic expiry-based prioritization reduces waste
- Streamlined approval process
- Batch operations for high-volume scenarios

### 2. **Enhanced Compliance**
- All mandatory fields enforced
- Complete audit trail
- Document management integration

### 3. **Better Inventory Management**
- FIFO ensures proper stock rotation
- Expiry tracking prevents waste
- Real-time inventory updates

### 4. **Increased Transparency**
- Clear workflow status
- Role-based visibility
- Comprehensive reporting

## ðŸ”® Next Steps

1. **Frontend Integration**: Update UI to support new workflow
2. **Notification System**: Add alerts for approvals and expiry warnings  
3. **Reporting Dashboard**: Create departure analytics and reports
4. **Mobile Support**: Extend API for mobile warehouse operations
5. **Integration Testing**: Comprehensive end-to-end testing

## ðŸ“ž Support

The enhanced departure flow is now fully implemented and ready for use. All existing functionality has been preserved while adding the new approval workflow and expiry-based FIFO capabilities.
